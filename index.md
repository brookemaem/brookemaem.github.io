### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

Lab 3, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I got to use a famous math equation and implement it into my own code. I enjoyed writing the input and output code using std::cin or std::cout. Then, using functions and values, I could reveal the number of day between two dates.

* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 1 was a fun game to program because although it was somewhat simple concept, it was entertaining and easy to follow. I like how I had to program it to allow the user to get multiple tries and then it would reveal the answer. Not only that, but my program would look at the argument size to see if there were exactly two arguments, otherwise, it would give an error message.

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 2 was definitely a challenge but one of my favorites. It consisted of finding out whether a number was prime or not and through that I had to use modulo to look at remainders. I learned that it would run through the test code and compare what I had with what it expected the result to be.
